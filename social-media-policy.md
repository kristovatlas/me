The following describes my personal policy for the use of social media.

# General

* Whenever possible, I avoid making any statement and answering any question that would violate a platform's acceptable use policy. I consider requests to breach this policy rude. 

# Twitter

## Disclaimers

* All views expressed are personal and do not necessarily reflect the views of any business or organization I am associated with. 
* Apparent views are also subject to flights of fancy, sarcasm, and rarely subterfuge. 
* Content on my feed is limited by my perceptions of Twitter terms of service and employers by whom I am contractually obligated.
* In the event that I broadcast a disaster for an online service (e.g. the hack of a Bitcoin exchange) which you cannot otherwise corroborate, please assume that my account has bene compromised in an attempt to manipulate crypto-currency markets.

## Follow Reciprocity

* With few exceptions, I will not mark a Twitter account as "followed" unless that account is already following me. I track any other accounts I am interested in with lists, some of which are private.
* I will only mark some of my Twitter followers as "followed," as some may be too inactive, dull, or aggravating.

## Blocking/Muting

* I liberally mute and block users.

## Like/Retweet

* I do not use the Twitter "Retweet" and "Like" functionality as intended by Twitter, but rather in line with how these functions actually work on the platform. 
* I use retweeting and quote tweeting to share things that I want to speak about or which I believe will be interesting to my followers. 
I use the "Like" function to signal boost tweets that I believe should be seen by a broader audience, but which may not necessarily be relevant to my followers.
* Use of "Retweet" or "Like" functionality are for signal boosting and do not in any way constitute my endorsement.
